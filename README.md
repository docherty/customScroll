Custom scroll bars using (non-jQuery) 'vanilla' js

I needed custom scrollbars on a project and ever solution I could find required jQuery. I put this simple template file here in case anyone else finds it useful.

Obviously, the JS and CSS can be split into separate files but I kept it together for easier copy and pasting.

## Tested on
- OSX (MacOS): Chrome, Safari
- Windows 10: Firefox, Edge 14

## Notes
- Firefox doesn't support turning off scrollbars (and still allowing content to scroll) so it needs to be hidden by pushing the scroll bars off to the right outside the wrapper.
